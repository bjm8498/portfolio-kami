## Explanation

Bloc Jams was my first project in the software developer program.  It is a replica based off of Spotify.  It was built initially set up through html and css.  Javascript was implemented after the initial template was set up and DOM scripting was utilized to set up some of the more complicated and volume heavy portions of the code.  After the DOM scripting and initial functions were set up JQuery was introduced to truly streamline the whole project.  Everything was linked and run through JQuery to smooth out the code and display a better picture of just how the site was composed.  Thanks to the assistance of primarily Mike Branski as well as help from other Bloc Mentors the site is fully functional and running.

## Problem

Bloc Jams is the first major project of the front end portion of software development cirriculum.  It was an introduction to functional programming, project management, command line and coding accountability simueltaneously and was overwhelming when I took on the project.  I ran into problems primarily with the command line due to using a unique shell as well as with functional programming due to my lack of experience.  The command line issues lingered on for a couple of weeks and the function building is still a work in progress in terms of my skill set.  The experience all at once was eye opening, maddening and fun.

##  Solution

Patience and a lot of help.  No further elaboration needed.

##  Results

I have a working replica of spotify in my portfolio.  The home page displays properly, animations run the way they were designed and most importantly I have music, working buttons and a play bar that tracks the song data.

##  Conclusion

I have come to understand the actual day to day process of being a software developer, having put together this site using four different languages, pulling together multiple outside sources and APIs together and getting them to run seamlessly has been a truly liberating experience.  I can say that I have a lot of work to do in terms of improving my skill set, but I have a better picture in mind in terms of building an app from the ground up and the resources that are available to compose a site.  I look forward to working towards my new career.
